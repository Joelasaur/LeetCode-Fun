// Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.

// For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name.

// Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.

// If you add periods ('.') between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be 
// forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.  
// For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.  (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)

// If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered,
// for example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)
// It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.
// Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many different addresses actually receive mails? 
// Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails
